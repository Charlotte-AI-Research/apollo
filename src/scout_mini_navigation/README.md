# Scout Mini Navigation Package (Phase 3 Skeleton)

Shared navigation workspace for Apollo Phase 3.
This package serves as a unified Nav2 configuration structure for all teams.

## Directory Overview
- `config/` → all YAML parameters
- `launch/` → team launch files
- `rviz/` → visualization setup

Each team contributes only to their assigned files.
No code or parameters are pre-filled — only placeholders.
