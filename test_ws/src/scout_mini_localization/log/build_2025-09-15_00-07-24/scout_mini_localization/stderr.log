[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findnav2_amcl.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "nav2_amcl", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "nav2_amcl" with
  any of the following names:

    nav2_amclConfig.cmake
    nav2_amcl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "nav2_amcl" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "nav2_amcl_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "nav2_amcl" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
